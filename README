Nouvel Ordre
============

A tool for reordering import statements inside Python code blocks.

Features
--------
* Blocks separated by anything (white line for instance) are considered separately.
* Statements inside a block are reordered
* Imports in one statement are reordered.
  Example::

    import sys, os

  becomes::

    import os, sys

  or::

    from module import b, a as f, c

  becomes::

    from module import a as f, b, c

Limitations
-----------

* This script will only handle first level statements.
* This script will not handle several "import module" for the same module in the same block.
