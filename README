Nouvel Ordre
============

A tool for reordering import statements inside Python code blocks.

Features
--------
* Blocks separated by anything (white line for instance) are considered separately.
* Statements inside a block are reordered
* Imports in one statement are reordered.
  Example::

    import sys, os

  becomes::

    import os, sys

  or::

    from module import b, a as f, c

  becomes::

    from module import a as f, b, c

Limitations
-----------

* This script will only handle first level statements.
* This script will not handle several "import module" for the same module in the same block.

Dependances
-----------

* Python 2.6 at least (for ast)
* enthought's python-traits
* Python 2.7 or python-argparse

Getting started
---------------
This is an executable script.

Options::

  --infile INFILE    a Python source file, defaults to standard input
  --outfile OUTFILE  output, defaults to standard output

This means equivalent common usages can be::

  $ nouvelordre.py --infile mymodule.py --outfile rewritten.py
  $ nouvelordre.py < mymodule.py > rewritten.py
